## üöÄ The Ultimate Setup Guide

Setting up this project involves two major parts. **Part A** is getting all your credentials from Facebook. **Part B** is setting up the GitHub repository to run the bot.

### **Part A: Facebook & Developer Prerequisites (The Hard Part)**

Before you touch the code, you need four critical things from Facebook. This can be tricky, so follow closely!

1.  **A Facebook Page:** You need a Facebook Page (not your personal profile) where you want to post the news. Create one if you don't have one.

2.  **Your Page ID:**
    -   Go to your Facebook Page.
    -   Click on **"About"** and scroll down to **"Page transparency"**.
    -   You will see your `Page ID`. **Copy this and save it.**

3.  **A Facebook Developer App & Access Token:**
    -   Go to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) and create a Developer Account.
    -   Click **"My Apps"** > **"Create App"**. Choose **"Business"** as the type.
    -   Give your app a name.
    -   From your new app's dashboard, go to **"Tools"** > **"Graph API Explorer"**.
    -   On the right side, under "Permissions", find and add these two permissions:
        -   `pages_read_engagement`
        -   `pages_manage_posts`
    -   Click **"Generate Access Token"**. Log in and authorize it for your desired page.
    -   The token it gives you is a *short-lived token*. We need a permanent one!
    -   Click the little "i" icon next to the token, then **"Open in Access Token Debugger"**.
    -   In the debugger, click the **"Extend Access Token"** button at the bottom.
    -   This will give you a **long-lived (60 day) Access Token**. **Copy this and save it.** It's what we will use.

4.  **Your Facebook Login Credentials:**
    -   The scraper uses Playwright to log into Facebook to read news posts. You will need the **email and password** of a valid Facebook account.

**You should now have these 4 things saved in a notepad:**
-   `Your Facebook Email`
-   `Your Facebook Password`
-   `Your Page ID`
-   `Your Long-Lived Access Token`

### **Part B: GitHub Repository Setup (The Easy Part)**

Now we will set up the project to use the credentials you just collected.

1.  **Fork this Repository:**
    -   Click the **"Fork"** button at the top-right of this page to create your own copy.

2.  **Add Your Secrets:**
    -   In your new forked repository, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
    -   You need to create **FOUR** secrets. Click **New repository secret** for each one:
        -   **Name:** `FB_EMAIL` -> **Value:** Your Facebook login email.
        -   **Name:** `FB_PASSWORD` -> **Value:** Your Facebook login password.
        -   **Name:** `PAGE_ID` -> **Value:** Your Facebook Page ID.
        -   **Name:** `ACCESS_TOKEN` -> **Value:** Your long-lived Access Token.

3.  **Enable and Run!**
    -   Go to the **"Actions"** tab of your repository. If prompted, click `I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them`.
    -   The bot will now run on its schedule! To trigger it manually, click on **"Run Scraper and Poster"** on the left, then the **"Run workflow"** button.
